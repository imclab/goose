Tornado MongoDB Boilerplate
===========================

This is my boilerplate to build a simple, fast and rock solid website. There
are quite many Tornado/MongoDB template projects out there, but I wanted to
start something from scratch, that fits my needs and evolves out of years of
experiences (positive and negative) with other Python based webframeworks like
`Turbogears`__ and `Django`__.

Of course this template is not designed for larger data structures. The main
focus is on scalability, fast data access and small library dependencies. For
this purpose, the Boilerplate uses the following applications/libraries:

 * `Tornado Webserver`__
 * `MongoDB`__
 * `Google Closure`__
 
Installation
============

Check out the source::

 $ git clone git://github.com/hkage/tornado-mongodb-boilerplate.git
 
Install the required Python libraries from within the project's directory::

 $ pip install -r requirements/stable-req.txt
 
And additionally also install the needed development tools::

 $ pip install -r requirements/dev-req.txt
 
Configuration
=============

Start the server
================

To start the final application, just run the following fabric command::

 $ fab devserver
 
This will tell Tornado to start the applicaton with the default port 8888. If
you want to use another port, just type::

 $ fab devserver:port=8000
 
In addition to that, see the fabfile.py Script for other parameters and comands.
